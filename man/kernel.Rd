\usage{
kernel(
  length,
  scale = 1,
  nugget = 1e-06,
  name = "sexp",
  prior_name = "ga",
  prior_coef = c(1.6, 0.3),
  nugget_est = FALSE,
  scale_est = FALSE,
  input_dim = NULL,
  connect = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{length}{a vector of lengthscales. The length of the vector equals to:
\enumerate{
\item either one if the lengthscales in the kernel function are assumed same across input dimensions; or
\item the total number of input dimensions, which is the sum of the number of feeding GP nodes
in the last layer (defined by the argument \code{input_dim}) and the number of connected global
input dimensions (defined by the argument \code{connect}), if the lengthscales in the kernel function
are assumed different across input dimensions.
}}

\item{scale}{the variance of a GP node. Defaults to \code{1}.}

\item{nugget}{the nugget term of a GP node. Defaults to \code{1e-6}.}

\item{name}{kernel function to be used. Either \code{"sexp"} for squared exponential kernel or
\code{"matern2.5"} for Mat√©rn-2.5 kernel. Defaults to \code{"sexp"}.}

\item{prior_name}{prior options for the lengthscales and nugget term. Either gamma (\code{"ga"}) or inverse gamma (\code{"inv_ga"}) distribution for
the lengthscales and nugget term. Set \code{NULL} to disable the prior. Defaults to \code{"ga"}.}

\item{prior_coef}{a vector that contains two values specifying the shape and rate
parameters of the gamma prior, or shape and scale parameters of the inverse gamma prior. Defaults to \code{c(1.6,0.3)}.}

\item{nugget_est}{set to \code{TRUE} to estimate the nugget term or to \code{FALSE} to fix the nugget term as specified
by the argument \code{nugget}. If set to \code{TRUE}, the value set to the argument \code{nugget} is used as the initial
value. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{scale_est}{set to \code{TRUE} to estimate the variance (i.e., scale) or to \code{FALSE} to fix the variance (i.e., scale) as specified
by the argument \code{scale}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{input_dim}{a vector that contains either
\enumerate{
\item the indices of GP nodes in the feeding layer whose outputs feed into this GP node; or
\item the indices of global input dimensions that are linked to the outputs of some feeding emulators,
if this GP node is in the first layer of a GP or DGP, which will be used for the linked emulation.
}

When set to \code{NULL},
\enumerate{
\item all outputs from the GP nodes in the feeding layer feed into this GP node; or
\item all global input dimensions feed into this GP node.
}

Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{connect}{a vector that contains the indices of dimensions in the global
input connecting to this GP node as additional input dimensions. When set to \code{NULL}, no global input
connection is implemented. Defaults to \code{NULL}. When this GP node is in the first layer of a GP or DGP emulator,
which will consequently be used for linked emulation, \code{connect} gives the indices of global input dimensions
that are not connected to some feeding emulators. In such a case, set \code{input_dim} to a vector of indices of
the remaining input dimensions that are connected to the feeding emulators.}
